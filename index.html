            <div class="subheading mb-3"><a href="https://relishiq.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Relish</a></div>
            <p>As Director of Engineering at RelishIQ, I lead the company's technical organization, which includes software development, DevOps, architecture, and quality assurance. I report directly to the CTO and have also served as interim VP of Technology, reporting to the CEO during that period. My role sits at the intersection of technology, product, and strategy, where I focus not only on execution, but on ensuring that everything we build is grounded in real business need.
              <br><br>
              Our cloud-based, multi-tenant SaaS platform supports enterprise procurement and spend management workflows. My job is to ensure that the technology behind it is not only secure, scalable, and maintainable—but also purposeful. I work closely with our architects and engineering leads to define system design patterns, quality standards, and implementation strategies that align with the outcomes our business and customers care about.
              <br><br>
              Beyond engineering execution, I partner with vendors, cloud providers, and internal stakeholders to optimize how we operate. This includes leading initiatives around cloud cost control, performance optimization, and usage efficiency across both AWS and Azure environments. I pay close attention to the ROI of our cloud investments, helping the company balance innovation with operational discipline.
              <br><br>
              Throughout my tenure, I've overseen the growth and maturing of several departments, including software engineering, QA (both manual and automation), and DevOps. I've helped define our architectural vision, drive adoption of modern development and testing practices, and mentor team leads and engineers at all levels. I also continue to collaborate with other functions—such as InfoSec and Support—to share knowledge, ensure continuity, and strengthen cross-functional alignment.

            <p>As Software Engineering Manager, I provided leadership and supervision to a robust team of 14 developers
              and quality assurance specialists. Our mission was to support our proprietary Workers Compensation Bill
              Review system. My team's responsibilities spanned several key areas:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Development and management of data ingestion and extraction applications, handling formats such as
                XML,
                ANSI X12, PDF, and TIFF images</li>
              <li>Development of a SaaS platform, encompassing both maintenance of a legacy .NET Web Form application
                and
                creation of a new Angular-based cloud-native application hosted on Azure App Services</li>
              <li>Management of the reporting platform, which involved the use of Crystal Reports, the SAP Business
                Objects BI platform, and a SQL Server Data Warehouse</li>
              <li>Oversight of compliance systems to ensure regulatory adherence</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Beyond team leadership, I was instrumental in advocating for and implementing SDLC best practices and
              coding standards across all teams. I also took a leading role in steering the ongoing migration to the
              Microsoft Azure platform.

            <p>My responsibilities were diverse, spanning from project requirement gathering to software design and
              development, along with meticulous planning using tools like Microsoft Project. A fundamental part of my
              role involved regular coordination with business stakeholders, which enabled us to establish
              implementation approaches, set cutover dates, and manage migration activities. I worked closely with the
              Software Architect, ensuring that our software development efforts were in line with accepted
              architectural practices.</p>
            <p>Upon the launch of each project, my focus shifted to comprehensive production support, involving
              monitoring project progress and providing transparent status updates to IT management.</p>
            <p>The projects I led were diverse and included the migration of an outdated Cobol-based system to the .NET
              Framework and creating new modules within the COBIS core banking engine. We further expanded our scope to
              third-party collaborations, integrating various service providers into our e-Banking application, which
              enriched the customers' banking experience.</p>
            <p>One of the team's notable achievements under my guidance was the development of ETL processes feeding the
              Business Objects BI platform, enhancing our data-driven decision-making capabilities. We also designed an
              in-house ticketing system for our ISO 20,000 certified organization, tailored to our unique corporate
              needs.</p>
            <p>Throughout my tenure, I strived to deliver high-quality software products that significantly contributed
